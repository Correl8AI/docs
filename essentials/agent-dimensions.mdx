## Discover high-signal dimensions

Correl8 scans your interaction data to find the dimensions and attributes that best explain changes in outcomes, such as conversion, retention, or task success.

Instead of requiring a predefined tracking plan, the agent infers useful fields from prompts, responses, metadata, and user context, then scores them by how predictive they are.

You will use this capability to decide which segments or attributes are worth turning into filters, dashboards, or product experiments.
