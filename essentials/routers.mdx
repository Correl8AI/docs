## Routers

Routers let you connect interaction traffic from existing LLM gateways into Correl8 without changing your application code.

They sit between your application and model providers, and can forward traces to Correl8 alongside your normal API calls.

## Supported routers

Today, Correl8 supports the following router:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="OpenRouter"
    icon="route"
    href="/essentials/openrouter"
    horizontal
  >
    Use OpenRouter Broadcast to stream traces from your LLM traffic into the S3 bucket Correl8 manages for your project.
  </Card>
</Columns>

As we add more routers, they will appear here with links to their specific setup guides.
