## Overview

The Correl8 agent turns raw interaction traces into analytics-ready events that you can query, segment, and track over time.

The core capabilities are:

- **Discover high-signal dimensions**: automatically surface attributes and fields that matter most for your analysis goals.
- **Reveal patterns and meaningful segments**: group interactions into cohorts based on intents, behaviors, and context.
- **Correlate with outcomes**: connect usage patterns to conversion, retention, and growth metrics.

Use the additional pages in this section to dive deeper into each of these capabilities.
