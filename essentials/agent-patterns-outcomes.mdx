## Reveal patterns and meaningful segments

The Correl8 agent groups interactions into coherent patterns and segments, capturing recurring intents, behaviors, and journeys across chat, voice, and images.

These segments help you answer questions like “which user journeys most often precede churn?” or “which intents show up in high-value accounts?”

## Correlate patterns with outcomes

Once segments are defined, Correl8 correlates them with your key outcomes — for example, conversion, activation, retention, or support resolution time.

This makes it easy to see which behaviors actually move the needle and where to focus product and growth efforts.
