## OpenRouter Broadcast to Correl8

OpenRouter's **Broadcast** feature lets you automatically send traces from your OpenRouter requests to external observability and analytics platforms.  
Instead of adding custom instrumentation in your application code, Broadcast forwards prompts, responses, timing, and metadata for each request to a destination you configure.

For Correl8, the destination is the **S3 bucket assigned to your project**. Correl8 ingests traces from this bucket and turns them into queryable events across chat, voice, and images.

## How it works

- **Source**: Your application sends LLM requests through OpenRouter as usual.  
- **Broadcast**: OpenRouter enables Broadcast for your account and streams trace data for each API request.  
- **Destination**: Broadcast writes trace payloads into the S3 bucket that Correl8 provisions for your project.  
- **Ingestion**: Correl8 continuously reads from this bucket, normalizes events, and correlates them with outcomes and user attributes.

## Configuration steps (high level)

1. **Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter**
   - In your OpenRouter dashboard, go to **Settings → Broadcast**.
   - Toggle **Enable Broadcast** for your account or organization.
2. **Point Broadcast to the Correl8 S3 bucket**
   - In your Correl8 onboarding or settings, locate the S3 bucket ARN / URL assigned to your project.
   - Add this bucket as the Broadcast destination in OpenRouter.
3. **Verify traces are flowing**
   - Make a few test requests through OpenRouter.
   - In Correl8, confirm that new interactions appear in your timelines / segments once ingestion runs.

We will add provider-specific screenshots and exact S3 configuration details here as the integration matures.
