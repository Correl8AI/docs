Correl8 is the product analytics for natural interfaces. It captures user interactions across chat, voice, and images, and automatically discovers high-signal dimensions and attributes based on the analysis end goal.

It then correlates these signals with outcomes and user information to surface patterns, events, and growth opportunities that would otherwise stay unknown.
